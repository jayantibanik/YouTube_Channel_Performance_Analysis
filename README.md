# YouTube_Channel_Performance_Analysis
Introduction-
This project showcases a YouTube Channel Performance Dashboard that highlights key metrics such as total videos, subscribers, revenue, and average view duration. It visualises insights on top revenue-generating videos, playlist watch time, engagement (likes, comments, shares), and daily monetised playbacks versus ad impressions. The dashboard also tracks CPM trends, revenue per 1000 views, and thumbnail CTR to provide a comprehensive view of channel growth and monetisation performance.

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
- 📊 Power BI Desktop – Main data visualisation platform used for creating interactive reports and dashboards.
- 🔄 Power Query – Applied for data cleaning, transformation, and reshaping YouTube analytics data.
- 📐 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and advanced metrics such as CPM and CTR.
- 🔗 Data Modelling – Relationships established among datasets (views, subscribers, revenue, engagement) to enable meaningful analysis.
- 🖼 File Format – .pbix for development and .png for dashboard preview.
